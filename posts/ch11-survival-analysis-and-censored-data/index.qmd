There are a number of big words in this chapter, but like all statistics they are intuitive in some sense. For survival analysis, it helps to remember that we are doing a regression but with a twist. The twist is that  we don't have data for all subjects throughout the trial since some may die in the middle. So let us start by breaking them down:



Survival Analysis
: A set of statistical methods for [analyzing the time until an event occurs]{.mark}. It is used when dealing with data where the outcome variable is the time until an event, and it's common to have some data where the event hasn't occurred by the end of the observation period (censored data).

Censored Data
: Data where the exact time of an event is not known. This often occurs in studies where the event of interest may not happen to all participants during the study's duration or when participants drop out of a study. There are different types of censoring, including:

Right Censoring
: The most common type, where the true event time is known to be at least as large as the observed time. This occurs when the event of interest happens after the observation period or if a participant drops out of the study.

Left Censoring
: The true event time is less than or equal to the observed time. For example, if a study surveys patients some time after a specific event and some patients have already experienced the event.

Interval Censoring
: The event time is known to fall within a specific interval. This can happen if data is collected periodically instead of continuously.

Survival Time $(T)$
: The time at which the event of interest occurs. This is also referred to as the failure time or event time.

Censoring Time $(C)$
: The time at which censoring occurs. For example, the time when a patient drops out of a study or when the study ends.

Observed Time $(Y)$
: The time that is actually observed, which is the minimum of the survival time and the censoring time. It is defined as $Y = min(T, C)$. If the event occurs before censoring, then $Y = T$. If censoring occurs before the event, then $Y = C$.

Status Indicator $(δ)$
: A variable indicating whether the event was observed or the data was censored. $δ = 1$ if the true survival time is observed $(T < C)$, and $δ = 0$ if censoring occurred $(T > C)$.

Independent Censoring
: An assumption that the censoring mechanism is unrelated to the event time, conditional on the features. Specifically, the event time $(T)$ is independent of the censoring time $(C)$, given the features. This assumption is crucial for many survival analysis methods, but it's often impossible to verify from the data.

Survival Curve/Survival Function $(S(t))$
: A function that quantifies the probability of surviving past time t. It is defined as $S(t) = Pr(T > t)$. This function is decreasing over time.

Risk Set
: The set of individuals who are still at risk of experiencing the event at a given time.

Kaplan-Meier Estimator
: A non-parametric estimator of the survival curve, which takes censoring into account. It calculates the probability of survival by considering the number of events and the number of individuals at risk at each event time. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve has a step-like shape.

Log-Rank Test
: A statistical test used to compare the survival curves of two or more groups. It examines how events unfold sequentially over time in each group.

Hazard Function/Hazard Rate (h(t))
: The instantaneous rate of death at time t, given survival past that time. It can be expressed as $h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} Pr(t < T \le t+Δt \mid T > t) / \Delta t$. It is a rate of death, rather than a probability of death.

Probability Density Function $(f(t))$
: The instantaneous rate of death at time t. It is defined as $f(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{Pr(t < T \le t+ \Delta t) }{ \Delta t}$.

Baseline Hazard $(h0(t))$
: In the Cox proportional hazards model, this is the hazard function for an individual with all features equal to zero. It is an unspecified function that serves as a reference point.

Proportional Hazards Assumption
: The assumption that the hazard function for an individual with feature vector xi is some unknown function $h_0(t)$ times a factor, $exp(\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}β_j)$. It implies that the ratio of hazards between two individuals is constant over time.

Relative Risk
: The quantity $exp(\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}β_j)$, representing the hazard for a given feature vector relative to the baseline hazard.

Cox Proportional Hazards Model
: A regression model for survival data that models the hazard function as a function of covariates. It is a semi-parametric model, which means that it does not require specification of the baseline hazard. The model estimates the effect of covariates on the hazard rate while avoiding the need to estimate the baseline hazard.

Partial Likelihood
: A likelihood function used in the Cox model to estimate the regression coefficients without needing to specify the baseline hazard function. It is the product of the probabilities of the observed events.

Harrell's Concordance Index (C-index)
: A measure of the predictive accuracy of a survival model. It represents the proportion of observation pairs for which the predicted order of survival times matches the observed order.

Time-Dependent Covariates
: Predictor variables whose values can change over time. The proportional hazards model can accommodate time-dependent covariates.

Survival Trees
: A modification of classification and regression trees for use in survival analysis. They use a split criterion that maximizes the difference between survival curves in resulting nodes.

Introduction to Survival Data and Censoring
:::

- Survival analysis concerns a special kind of outcome variable: the time until an event occurs.
- For example, suppose that we have conducted a five-year medical study, in which patients have been treated for cancer.
- We would like to fit a model to predict patient survival time, using features such as baseline health measurements or type of treatment.
- Sounds like a **regression problem**. But there is an important complication: some of the patients have survived until the end of the study. Such a patient’s survival time is said to
be **censored**.
- We do not want to discard this subset of surviving patients, since the fact that they survived at least five years amounts to valuable information.
- The roots of survival analysis seem rather mundane like estimating the wear and tear of carpets or the life expectancy of light bulbs. But the basic models developed for these problems have found wide applications
- The applications of survival analysis extend far beyond medicine. For example, consider a company that wishes to model churn, the event when customers cancel subscription to a service.
- The company might collect data on customers over some time period, in order to predict each customer’s time to cancellation.
- However, presumably not all customers will have cancelled their subscription by the end of this time period; for such customers, the time to cancellation is censored.
- Survival analysis is a very well-studied topic within statistics. However, it has received relatively little  attention in the machine learning community.

- Survival and Censoring Times
    - For each individual, we suppose that there is a true failure or event time T, as well as a true censoring time C. 
    - The survival time represents the time at which the event of interest occurs (such as death).
    - By contrast, the censoring is the time at which censoring occurs: for example, the time at which the patient drops out of the study or the study ends.
    - We observe either the survival time T or else the censoring time C. Specifically, we observe the random variable 
$$
Y = min(T,C) \qquad
$$ {#eq-observed-time}

    - If the event occurs before censoring (i.e. T < C) then we observe the true survival time T; if censoring occurs before the event (T > C) then we observe the censoring time. We also observe a status indicator,
$$
\delta = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } T \leq C, \\
    0 & \text{if } T > C.
\end{cases} \qquad
$$ {#eq-status-indicator}

    - Finally, in our dataset we observe $n$ pairs $(Y,δ)$, which we denote as $(y_1,δ_1),\ldots, (y_n,δ_n)$.

![](fig-survival-data.png){.column-margin}

## A Closer Look at Censoring {#sec-11-2}

- Suppose that a number of patients drop out of a cancer study early because they are very sick.
- An analysis that does not take into consideration the reason why the patients dropped out will likely overestimate the true average survival time.
- Similarly, suppose that males who are very sick are more likely to drop out of the study than females who are very sick. Then a comparison of male and female survival times
may wrongly suggest that males survive longer than females.
- In general, we need to assume that, conditional on the features, the event time T is independent of the censoring time C. The two examples above violate the assumption of independent censoring.

## The Kaplan–Meier Survival Curve {#sec-11-3}

- The Survival Curve
    - The survival function (or curve) is defined as 
    $$
    S(t) = Pr(T > t) \qquad
    $$ {#eq-survival-function}
    - This decreasing function quantifies the probability of surviving past time t.
    - For example, suppose that a company is interested in modeling customer churn. Let T represent the time that a customer cancels a subscription to the company’s service.
    - Then S(t) represents the probability that a customer cancels later than time t. The larger the value of S(t), the less likely that the customer will cancel before time t
- Estimating the Survival Curve
   - Consider the BrainCancer dataset, which contains the survival times for patients with primary brain tumors undergoing treatment with stereotactic radiation methods.
    - The predictors are gtv (gross tumor volume, in cubic centimeters); sex (male or female); diagnosis (meningioma, LG glioma, HG glioma, or other); loc (the tumor location:
either infratentorial or supratentorial); ki (Karnofsky index); and stereo (stereotactic method).
    - Only 53 of the 88 patients were still alive at the end of the
study.
    - Suppose we’d like to estimate $S(20) = Pr(T > 20)$, the probability that a patient survives for at least 20 months, 
    - It is tempting to simply compute the proportion of patients who are known to have survived past 20 months, that is, the proportion of patients for whom $Y > 20$.
    - This turns out to be 48/88, or approximately 55%.
    - However, this does not seem quite right: 17 of the 40 patients who did not survive to 20 months were actually censored, and this analysis implicitly assumes they died before 20 months. Hence it is probably an underestimate

## The Log-Rank Test {#sec-11-4}

-  Females seem to fare a little better up to about 50 months, but then the two curves both level off to about 50%. How can we carry out a formal test of equality of the two
survival curves?
- At first glance, a two-sample t-test seems like an obvious choice: but the presence of censoring again creates a complication.
- To overcome this challenge, we will conduct a log-rank test.  
- Recall that $d1 < d2 < ···< dK$ are the unique death times among the non-censored patients, rk is the number of patients at risk at time dk, and qk is the number of patients who died at time dk.
- We further define $r_{1k}$ and $r_{2k}$ to be the number of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, who are at risk at time $d_k$.
-  Similarly, we define $q_{1k}$ and $q_{2k}$ to be the number of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, who died at time $d_k$. Note that $r_{1k} + r_{2k} = rk$ and $q_{1k} + q_{2k} = q_k.$

Details of the Test Statistic:

|       | Group 1 | Group 2 | Total |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| Died  | $q_{1k}$     | $q_{2k}$     | $q_k$    |
| Survived | $r_{1k} − q_{1k}$ | $r_{2k} − q_{2k}$ | $r_k − q_k$ |
| Total | $r_{1k}$     | $r_{2k}$     | $r_k$    |

: Among the set of patients at risk at time $d_k$ , the number of patients who died and survived in each of two groups is reported {#tbl-log-rank-test .column-margin}

- The log-rank test statistic is given by At each death time dk, we construct a 2 ×2 table of counts of the form shown above.
- Note that if the death times are unique (i.e. no two individuals die at the same time), then one of $q_{1k}$ and $q_{2k}$ equals one, and the other equals zero.

Log Rank Test: the Main Idea

- To test $H_0 : \mathbb{E}[X] = 0$ for some random variable $X$, one approach is to construct a test statistic of the form:
$$
W = \frac{X-\mathbb{E}[X]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}} \qquad
$$ {#eq-log-rank-test}

- where $\mathbb{E}[X]$ and $Var(X)$ are the expectation and variance, respectively, of $X$ under $H_0$.
- In order to construct the log-rank test statistic, we compute a quantity that takes exactly the form above, with $X = \sum_{k=1}^K q_{1k}$, where $q_{1k}$ is given in the top left of the
table above.

- The Final Result
    - The resulting formula for the log-rank test statistic is:
$$
W = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^K (q_{1k}- \mathbb{E}(q_{1k}) )}{\sqrt{ \sum_{k=1}^K Var (q_{1k})}} 
= \frac{\sum_{k=1}^K (q_{1k}- \frac{q_k}{r_k} r_{1k})}{\sqrt{ \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{q_k}{(r_k-1)} (r_{1k}/r_k)(1-r_{1k}/r_k)(r_k-q_k)}} \qquad
$$ {#eq-log-rank-test-statistic}

    - When the sample size is large, the log-rank test statistic $W$ has approximately a standard normal distribution.
    - This can be used to compute a p-value for the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the survival curves in the two groups.

- Application to the Brain Cancer Dataset
    - Comparing the survival times of females and males on the BrainCancer data gives a log-rank test statistic of W = 1.2, which corresponds to a two-sided p-value of 0.2.
    - Thus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no difference in survival curves between females and males.
    - The log-rank test is closely related to Cox’s proportional hazards model, which we discuss next.

## Regression Models With a Survival Response {#sec-11-5}

- We now consider the task of fitting a regression model to survival data.
- We wish to predict the true survival time T. Since the observed quantity Y = min(T,C) is positive and may have a long right tail, we might be tempted to fit a linear regression of log(Y ) on X. But [censoring again
creates a problem.]{.mark}
- [To overcome this difficulty, we instead make use of a sequential construction, similar to the idea used for the Kaplan-Meier survival curve.]{.mark}

### The Hazard Function {#sec-11-5-1}

- The hazard function or hazard rate — also known as the force of mortality — is formally defined as
$$
h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{Pr(t < T \le t + \Delta t \mid T > t)}{\Delta t} \qquad
$$ {#eq-hazard-function}

- where $T$ is the (true) survival time.
- It is the death rate in the instant after time t, given survival up to that time.
- The hazard function is the basis for the **Proportional Hazards Model**.

### Proportional Hazards {#sec-11-5-2}

::: {#fig-v11.2 .column-margin}
{{< video https://youtu.be/lP42Vly2MVg?list=PLoROMvodv4rOzrYsAxzQyHb8n_RWNuS1e >}}

Proportional Hazards Model
:::

- The proportional hazards assumption states that:
$$
h(t|xi) = h_0(t) exp \left( \sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij} \beta_j \right) \qquad
$$ {#eq-proportional-hazards}

- where $h_0(t) ≥ 0$ is an unspecified function, known as the baseline hazard. It is the hazard function for an individual with features $x_{i1} = \ldots = x_{ip} = 0$.
-  The name proportional hazards arises from the fact that the hazard function for an individual with feature vector $x_i$ is some unknown function $h_0(t)$ times the factor $exp \left( \sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij} \beta_j \right)$. . The quantity $exp \left( \sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij} \beta_j \right)$ is called the relative risk for the feature vector $x_i = (x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ip})$, relative to that for the feature vector $x_i = (0, \ldots, 0)$.
- The Cox model estimates the regression coefficients $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$ by maximizing a partial likelihood function. This function is the product of the probabilities of the observed events, and it does not require specification of the baseline hazard function $h_0(t)$.
- What does it mean that the baseline hazard function $h_0(t)$ is unspecified?
- Basically, we make no assumptions about its functional form. We allow the instantaneous probability of death at time t, given that one has survived at least until time t, to take any form.
- This means that the hazard function is very flexible and can model a wide range of relationships between the covariates and survival time.
- Our only assumption is that a one-unit increase in xij corresponds to an increase in $h(t \mid x_i)$ by a factor of $exp(β_j)$.
