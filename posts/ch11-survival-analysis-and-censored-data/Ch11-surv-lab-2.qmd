# Survival Analysis {#sec-survival-analysis}

We begin by importing some of our libraries at this top level.

```{python}
from matplotlib.pyplot import subplots
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from ISLP.models import ModelSpec as MS
from ISLP import load_data
from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter, CoxPHFitter
from lifelines.statistics import logrank_test, multivariate_logrank_test
from ISLP.survival import sim_time

km = KaplanMeierFitter()
coxph = CoxPHFitter
```


## Publication Data {#sec-pub}

The  `Publication`  data   presented in Section~\ref{sec:pub}  can be found in the `ISLP` package.
We first reproduce Figure~\ref{fig:lauersurv}  by plotting the Kaplan-Meier curves stratified on the  `posres`  variable, which records whether the study had a positive or negative result.

```{python}
fig, ax = subplots(figsize=(8,8))
Publication = load_data('Publication')
by_result = {}
for result, df in Publication.groupby('posres'):
    by_result[result] = df
    km_result = km.fit(df['time'], df['status'])
    km_result.plot(label='Result=%d' % result, ax=ax)

```
 
As discussed previously, the $p$-values from fitting Coxâ€™s
proportional hazards model to the `posres` variable are quite
large, providing no evidence of a difference in time-to-publication
between studies with positive versus negative results.

```{python}
posres_df = MS(['posres',
                'time',
                'status'],
                intercept=False).fit_transform(Publication)
posres_fit = coxph().fit(posres_df,
                         'time',
                         'status')
posres_fit.summary[['coef', 'se(coef)', 'p']]

```
    
 
However, the results change dramatically when we include other
predictors in the model. Here we exclude the funding mechanism
variable.

```{python}
model = MS(Publication.columns.drop('mech'),
           intercept=False)
coxph().fit(model.fit_transform(Publication),
            'time',
            'status').summary[['coef', 'se(coef)', 'p']]

```
    
We see that there are a number of statistically significant variables,
including whether the trial focused on a clinical endpoint, the impact
of the study, and whether the study had positive or negative results.
