![Deep Learning in a nutshell](/images/in_a_nutshell.jpg)

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. It has been applied to a wide range of applications, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. Deep learning models are typically trained on large datasets using a technique called backpropagation, which adjusts the model's weights to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output. Popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
