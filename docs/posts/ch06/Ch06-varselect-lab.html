<p>We will apply the forward-selection approach to the <code>Hitters</code> data. We wish to predict a baseball player’s <code>Salary</code> on the basis of various statistics associated with performance in the previous year.</p>
<p>First of all, we note that the <code>Salary</code> variable is missing for some of the players. The <code>np.isnan()</code> function can be used to identify the missing observations. It returns an array of the same shape as the input vector, with a <code>True</code> for any elements that are missing, and a <code>False</code> for non-missing elements. The <code>sum()</code> method can then be used to count all of the missing elements.</p>

<p>As an alternative to using <span class="math inline">C_p</span>, we might try cross-validation to select a model in forward selection. For this, we need a method that stores the full path of models found in forward selection, and allows predictions for each of these. This can be done with the <code>sklearn_selection_path()</code> estimator from <code>ISLP.models</code>. The function <code>cross_val_predict()</code> from <code>ISLP.models</code> computes the cross-validated predictions for each of the models along the path, which we can use to evaluate the cross-validated MSE along the path.</p>
<p>Here we define a strategy that fits the full forward selection path. While there are various parameter choices for <code>sklearn_selection_path()</code>, we use the defaults here, which selects the model at each step based on the biggest reduction in RSS.</p>

<p>This gives us an array of fitted values — 20 steps in all, including the fitted mean for the null model — which we can use to evaluate in-sample MSE. As expected, the in-sample MSE improves each step we take, indicating we must use either the validation or cross-validation approach to select the number of steps. We fix the y-axis to range from 50,000 to 250,000 to compare to the cross-validation and validation set MSE below, as well as other methods such as ridge regression, lasso and principal components regression.</p>

<p>We are now ready to use cross-validation to estimate test error along the model path. We must use <em>only the training observations</em> to perform all aspects of model-fitting — including variable selection. Therefore, the determination of which model of a given size is best must be made using in each training fold. This point is subtle but important. If the full data set is used to select the best subset at each step, then the validation set errors and cross-validation errors that we obtain will not be accurate estimates of the test error.</p>

<p><code>skm.cross_val_predict()</code> The prediction matrix <code>Yhat_cv</code> is the same shape as <code>Yhat_in</code>; the difference is that the predictions in each row, corresponding to a particular sample index, were made from models fit on a training fold that did not include that row.</p>
<p>At each model along the path, we compute the MSE in each of the cross-validation folds. These we will average to get the mean MSE, and can also use the individual values to compute a crude estimate of the standard error of the mean. {The estimate is crude because the five error estimates are based on overlapping training sets, and hence are not independent.} Hence we must know the test indices for each cross-validation split. This can be found by using the <code>split()</code> method of <code>kfold</code>. Because we fixed the random state above, whenever we split any array with the same number of rows as <span class="math inline">Y</span> we recover the same training and test indices, though we simply ignore the training indices below.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="best-subset-selection">Best Subset Selection</h3>
<p>Forward stepwise is a <em>greedy</em> selection procedure; at each step it augments the current set by including one additional variable. We now apply best subset selection to the <code>Hitters</code> data, which for every subset size, searches for the best set of predictors.</p>
<p>We will use a package called <code>l0bnb</code> to perform best subset selection. Instead of constraining the subset to be a given size, this package produces a path of solutions using the subset size as a penalty rather than a constraint. Although the distinction is subtle, the difference comes when we cross-validate.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ridge-regression-and-the-lasso">Ridge Regression and the Lasso</h2>
<p>We will use the <code>sklearn.linear_model</code> package (for which we use <code>skl</code> as shorthand below) to fit ridge and lasso regularized linear models on the <code>Hitters</code> data. We start with the model matrix <code>X</code> (without an intercept) that we computed in the previous section on best subset regression.</p>
<section id="ridge-regression" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ridge-regression">Ridge Regression</h3>
<p>We will use the function <code>skl.ElasticNet()</code> to fit both ridge and the lasso. To fit a <em>path</em> of ridge regressions models, we use <code>skl.ElasticNet.path()</code>, which can fit both ridge and lasso, as well as a hybrid mixture; ridge regression corresponds to <code>l1_ratio=0</code>. It is good practice to standardize the columns of <code>X</code> in these applications, if the variables are measured in different units. Since <code>skl.ElasticNet()</code> does no normalization, we have to take care of that ourselves. Since we standardize first, in order to find coefficient estimates on the original scale, we must <em>unstandardize</em> the coefficient estimates. The parameter <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> in () and () is called <code>alphas</code> in <code>sklearn</code>. In order to be consistent with the rest of this chapter, we use <code>lambdas</code> rather than <code>alphas</code> in what follows. {At the time of publication, ridge fits like the one in code chunk [22] issue unwarranted convergence warning messages; we expect these to disappear as this package matures.}</p>

<p>Here we extract the array of coefficients corresponding to the solutions along the regularization path. By default the <code>skl.ElasticNet.path</code> method fits a path along an automatically selected range of <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> values, except for the case when <code>l1_ratio=0</code>, which results in ridge regression (as is the case here). {The reason is rather technical; for all models except ridge, we can find the smallest value of <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> for which all coefficients are zero. For ridge this value is <span class="math inline">\infty</span>.} So here we have chosen to implement the function over a grid of values ranging from <span class="math inline">\lambda=10^{8}</span> to <span class="math inline">\lambda=10^{-2}</span> scaled by the standard deviation of <span class="math inline">y</span>, essentially covering the full range of scenarios from the null model containing only the intercept, to the least squares fit.</p>
<p>Associated with each value of <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> is a vector of ridge regression coefficients, that can be accessed by a column of <code>soln_array</code>. In this case, <code>soln_array</code> is a <span class="math inline">19 \times 100</span> matrix, with 19 rows (one for each predictor) and 100 columns (one for each value of <span class="math inline">\lambda</span>).</p>
<p>We transpose this matrix and turn it into a data frame to facilitate viewing and plotting.</p>

<p>(We have used <code>latex</code> formatting in the horizontal label, in order to format the Greek <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> appropriately.) We expect the coefficient estimates to be much smaller, in terms of <span class="math inline">\ell_2</span> norm, when a large value of <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> is used, as compared to when a small value of <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> is used. (Recall that the <span class="math inline">\ell_2</span> norm is the square root of the sum of squared coefficient values.)

<p>Notice that the operation <code>pipe.fit(X, Y)</code> above has changed the <code>ridge</code> object, and in particular has added attributes such as <code>coef_</code> that were not there before. ### Estimating Test Error of Ridge Regression Choosing an <em>a priori</em> value of <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> for ridge regression is difficult if not impossible. We will want to use the validation method or cross-validation to select the tuning parameter. The reader may not be surprised that the <code>Pipeline()</code> approach can be used in <code>skm.cross_validate()</code> with either a validation method (i.e.&nbsp;<code>validation</code>) or <span class="math inline">k</span>-fold cross-validation.</p>
<p>We fix the random state of the splitter so that the results obtained will be reproducible.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fast-cross-validation-for-solution-paths">Fast Cross-Validation for Solution Paths</h3>
<p>The ridge, lasso, and elastic net can be efficiently fit along a sequence of <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> values, creating what is known as a <em>solution path</em> or <em>regularization path</em>. Hence there is specialized code to fit such paths, and to choose a suitable value of <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> using cross-validation. Even with identical splits the results will not agree <em>exactly</em> with our <code>grid</code> above because the standardization of each feature in <code>grid</code> is carried out on each fold, while in <code>pipeCV</code> below it is carried out only once. Nevertheless, the results are similar as the normalization is relatively stable across folds.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluating-test-error-of-cross-validated-ridge">Evaluating Test Error of Cross-Validated Ridge</h3>
<p>Choosing <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> using cross-validation provides a single regression estimator, similar to fitting a linear regression model as we saw in Chapter~. It is therefore reasonable to estimate what its test error is. We run into a problem here in that cross-validation will have <em>touched</em> all of its data in choosing <span class="math inline">\lambda</span>, hence we have no further data to estimate test error. A compromise is to do an initial split of the data into two disjoint sets: a training set and a test set. We then fit a cross-validation tuned ridge regression on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set. We might call this cross-validation nested within the validation set approach. A priori there is no reason to use half of the data for each of the two sets in validation. Below, we use 75% for training and 25% for test, with the estimator being ridge regression tuned using 5-fold cross-validation. This can be achieved in code as follows:</p>

<p>We saw that ridge regression with a wise choice of <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> can outperform least squares as well as the null model on the <code>Hitters</code> data set. We now ask whether the lasso can yield either a more accurate or a more interpretable model than ridge regression. In order to fit a lasso model, we once again use the <code>ElasticNetCV()</code> function; however, this time we use the argument <code>l1_ratio=1</code>. Other than that change, we proceed just as we did in fitting a ridge model.</p>

<p>However, the lasso has a substantial advantage over ridge regression in that the resulting coefficient estimates are sparse. Here we see that 6 of the 19 coefficient estimates are exactly zero.

<p>Principal components regression (PCR) can be performed using <code>PCA()</code> from the <code>sklearn.decomposition</code> module. We now apply PCR to the <code>Hitters</code> data, in order to predict <code>Salary</code>. Again, ensure that the missing values have been removed from the data, as described in Section~.</p>
<p>We use <code>LinearRegression()</code> to fit the regression model here. Note that it fits an intercept by default, unlike the <code>OLS()</code> function seen earlier in Section~.</p>

<p>We see that the smallest cross-validation error occurs when 17 components are used. However, from the plot we also see that the cross-validation error is roughly the same when only one component is included in the model. This suggests that a model that uses just a small number of components might suffice.</p>
<p>The CV score is provided for each possible number of components from 1 to 19 inclusive. The <code>PCA()</code> method complains if we try to fit an intercept only with <code>n_components=0</code> so we also compute the MSE for just the null model with these splits.</p>

<p>Briefly, we can think of this as the amount of information about the predictors that is captured using <span class="math inline">M</span> principal components. For example, setting <span class="math inline">M=1</span> only captures 38.31% of the variance, while <span class="math inline">M=2</span> captures an additional 21.84%, for a total of 60.15% of the variance. By <span class="math inline">M=6</span> it increases to 88.63%. Beyond this the increments continue to diminish, until we use all <span class="math inline">M=p=19</span> components, which captures all 100% of the variance.</p>
